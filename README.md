# 2D-java-drone
A drone that simulates thrust and gravity in 2D space --- part of my 2022 SURF research projects

### Overview
A 2D drone based on SLF4J and PID flight attitude control. The software simulates gravity and the thrust of the drone's two engines, allowing users to control the aircraft using a keyboard. The interface can display various parameters of the current environment and drone, including linear velocity, angular velocity, engine thrust, waypoint position, etc. The software has six built-in waypoints for players to control the aircraft through, and you can also customize the route.

### Deploy
Run the Thrust.java file to start.

### Versions

v0.9.5-pre-build: added manual operation,PID flight control, basic interface.
